When it comes to my computer, I tend to keep things simple these days. I don’t want to put up a fight or constantly have to fix what isn’t broken. I’m not looking for endless tweaks, flashy extras, or software “experiments” that end up breaking something down the line. I simply want my system to start up, run smoothly, and get out of the way so I can actually use it.

This means I install only what I truly need. Every program on my system has a purpose. If it’s not helping me work, create, game, or stay productive, it doesn’t belong here. I’m not curating a collection or following someone else's blueprint; I’m crafting a system built entirely aorund me.

This approach keeps my system streamlined. No bloat slowing me down. No mystery processes chewing up resources. Just a clean, minimal setup that stays quick and predictable. And because there’s less stuff installed, there’s less to break. With fewer things installed, updates are a breeze, quick, painless, and usually problem-free.

Arch fits my mindset perfectly. I install it once, set it up exactly how I want, and from there, I just simply forever update it. I don’t have to deal with the stop-and-go upgrade cycle of point-release distributions, where you jump from one version to the next. Instead, Arch’s rolling updates keep everything moving forward without disruptive version jumps; my system just quietly stays current.

I don’t run my computer for the sake of tinkering with it, I run it to get things done. It’s not a playground, it’s a workspace. My setup isn’t about chasing trends or collecting tools I’ll never use; it’s about keeping the essentials sharp and ready. The less I have to think about my operating system, the better it’s doing its job.
