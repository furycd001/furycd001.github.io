      <description>In the late 2000s, Starbucks emerged as more than just a coffee haven; it became a social hub and a place to connect with friends and colleagues. However, during this period, the concept of free WiFi was not as ubiquitous as it is today. Instead, Starbucks UK offered a WiFi experience that required payment for access.&#xA;The Era of Paid WiFi at Starbucks UK.. Around 2006 and 2007, Starbucks introduced its WiFi service to stores across the UK &amp;amp; Ireland, offering customers the opportunity to access the internet while sipping their favorite beverages.</description>

      <description>Ideas, thoughts &amp;amp; Ramblings&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s what this blog is all about. After spending a few days playing around with Hugo offline, I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered that I actually quite like it. It&amp;rsquo;s like a refreshing change.&#xA;A Fresh Start.. Initially, my plan was to transfer all my old blog posts from Publii to this new blog. However, upon reflection, I decided against it. A few of those posts were of low quality, and frankly, I have no idea why I ever published them.</description>

      <description>After using publii for several years, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally decided to switch to Hugo. I made the switch because I wanted a more minimalistic, less clunky, and easier-to-maintain solution.&#xA;At the moment, I&amp;rsquo;m just testing Hugo, and this post is primarily for experimental purposes. After re-uploading a few posts from my previous blog, I&amp;rsquo;ll look at my feelings towards Hugo based on my experience and the results. Depending on how I feel about it, I may or may not stick with Hugo.</description>
