After using [publii](https://getpublii.com/) for several years, I've finally decided to switch to Hugo. I made the switch because I wanted a more minimalistic, less clunky, and easier-to-maintain solution.

At the moment, I'm just testing Hugo, and this post is primarily for experimental purposes. After re-uploading a few posts from my previous blog, I'll look at my feelings towards Hugo based on my experience and the results. Depending on how I feel about it, I may or may not stick with Hugo. I'm also considering other options, such as [Jenny](https://github.com/hmngwy/jenny) and [Bashblog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog which are on my radar as potential alternatives to explore and try.
