      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a cosy kitchen, a computer sat quietly in the corner underneath a black wooden desk. A reliable companion in a world increasingly dominated by sleek, modern devices. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t old, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t brand new either—a comfortable middle ground. Running Linux, it represented a blend of stability and versatility, though not without its quirks. Its owner didn’t ask for much—just for it to work as expected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every morning, the computer was powered on with a sense of hope. The familiar hum of the fan and the soft glow of the screen brought a small but significant comfort. Its operating system, a sturdy version of Linux, booted up smoothly most days. However, there were times when unexpected glitches would appear—a program crashing here, a slow response there. These minor annoyances didn’t make the computer boring; they added a layer of challenge, a puzzle to solve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;ideas-thoughts--ramblings&#34;&gt;Ideas, thoughts &amp;amp; Ramblings&amp;hellip;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;that&amp;rsquo;s what this blog is all about. After spending a few days playing around with Hugo offline, I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered that I actually quite like it. It&amp;rsquo;s like a refreshing change.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-fresh-start&#34;&gt;A Fresh Start..&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Initially, my plan was to transfer all my old blog posts from Publii to this new blog. However, upon reflection, I decided against it. A few of those posts were of low quality, and frankly, I have no idea why I ever published them. This fresh start gives me the opportunity to be more selective and thoughtful about the content I share.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
