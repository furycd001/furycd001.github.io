      <description>Ideas, thoughts &amp;amp; Ramblings&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s what this blog is all about. After spending a few days playing around with Hugo offline, I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered that I actually quite like it. It&amp;rsquo;s like a refreshing change.&#xA;A Fresh Start.. Initially, my plan was to transfer all my old blog posts from Publii to this new blog. However, upon reflection, I decided against it. A few of those posts were of low quality, and frankly, I have no idea why I ever published them.</description>

      <description>After using publii for several years, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally decided to switch to Hugo. I made the switch because I wanted a more minimalistic, less clunky, and easier-to-maintain solution.&#xA;At the moment, I&amp;rsquo;m just testing Hugo, and this post is primarily for experimental purposes. After re-uploading a few posts from my previous blog, I&amp;rsquo;ll look at my feelings towards Hugo based on my experience and the results. Depending on how I feel about it, I may or may not stick with Hugo.</description>
