Though small in size, Gleno is a village steeped in local lore, natural beauty, and historical significance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;origins-and-name&#34;&gt;Origins and Name&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The name Gleno derives from the Irish Gleann Abhann, which means &amp;ldquo;glen of the river&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;valley of the stream.&amp;rdquo; The village is located near a scenic waterfall that feeds into a meandering stream, a feature that has shaped much of its early history. Gleno&amp;rsquo;s tranquil surroundings, characterized by rolling hills and lush greenery, have made it an attractive spot for human settlement for centuries, with roots stretching back to early farming communities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
