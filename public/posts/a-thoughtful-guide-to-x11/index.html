    <p>In the ever-evolving world of Linux desktop environments, there&rsquo;s been a clear trend: <strong>Wayland</strong> is growing. It&rsquo;s sleek, modern, and promises a more secure and efficient future. But for many of us, <strong>Xorg (X11)</strong> still represents stability, flexibility, and control.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re on older hardware, running highly configurable window managers, or just appreciate the tried-and-true reliability of X11, this post is for you.</p>
<p>Let’s explore the wide variety of <strong>Xorg-based desktop environments</strong> that continue to thrive, not as resistance to change, but as a celebration of <em>freedom of choice</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-choose-xorg-today">Why Choose Xorg Today?</h2>
<p>Before diving into the desktop environments, let’s consider why you may still stick with Xorg:</p>
<p><strong>Mature software support..</strong><br>
Xorg has been around for decades and remains well-supported by a majority of desktop applications and toolkits.</p>
<p><strong>Better compatibility..</strong><br>
Certain graphics drivers, legacy applications, and niche tools still work best, <em>or only</em> on Xorg.</p>
<p><strong>Freedom of choice..</strong><br>
In the Linux world, choosing your tools is a feature, not a flaw. Xorg offers one of many valid paths.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="desktop-environments-that-use-xorg-alphabetical-list">Desktop Environments That Use Xorg (Alphabetical List)</h2>
<p>These environments either run exclusively on Xorg or offer robust support for it, even if they’re exploring Wayland compatibility. Some are minimal, others full-featured, but all respect the X11 legacy.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="afterstep"><strong><a href="http://www.afterstep.org/">AfterStep</a></strong></h3>
<p>Inspired by NeXTSTEP, AfterStep offers a unique aesthetic with docks and wharfs. Lightweight and resource-efficient, it remains a visual throwback with modern functionality.</p>
<hr>

<hr>
<h2 id="final-thoughts-its-not-about-old-vs-new">Final Thoughts: It’s Not About “Old vs New”</h2>
<p>Wayland brings promise, and for many, it’s the right choice. But choice is the keyword here. Xorg still serves an essential role in modern Linux computing, especially where flexibility, performance, or legacy hardware is concerned.</p>
<p>This isn’t about holding back progress. It’s about respecting diverse workflows and making sure users can run what they want, how they want.</p>
<p>So whether you’re a minimalist, a power user, or just someone who prefers what works Xorg still has a place at the table.</p>
