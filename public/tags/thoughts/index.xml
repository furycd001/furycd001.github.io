      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why the Illusion of “Thinking Machines” Is More Dangerous Than You Think&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every day, we are invited — encouraged, even — to imagine AI as something eerily like ourselves. It talks like us. It “feels” like us. It offers comfort, guidance, inspiration. It tells jokes, writes poetry, composes music, translates languages, generates ideas, and even apologises when it gets things wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is, in so many ways, designed to appear human.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Thoughtful Guide to X11 Desktop Environments</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/a-thoughtful-guide-to-x11/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the ever-evolving world of Linux desktop environments, there&amp;rsquo;s been a clear trend: &lt;strong&gt;Wayland&lt;/strong&gt; is growing. It&amp;rsquo;s sleek, modern, and promises a more secure and efficient future. But for many of us, &lt;strong&gt;Xorg (X11)&lt;/strong&gt; still represents stability, flexibility, and control.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;rsquo;re on older hardware, running highly configurable window managers, or just appreciate the tried-and-true reliability of X11, this post is for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore the wide variety of &lt;strong&gt;Xorg-based desktop environments&lt;/strong&gt; that continue to thrive, not as resistance to change, but as a celebration of &lt;em&gt;freedom of choice&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When Minimalism Misses the Mark</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/when-minimalism-misses-the-mark/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Minimalist design, when done well, can be timeless. It can speak softly but leave a lasting impression. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s a website, a product package, or a brand identity, good minimalist design doesn’t just strip away excess, it reveals the essence of what&amp;rsquo;s left. That’s what I love about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But lately, something I’ve observed repeatedly has made me pause, reflect, and think.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much of what gets labeled as “minimalist” today, especially in branding, packaging, and web design, feels hollow. It often seems rushed, as if minimalism has become a shortcut rather than a design philosophy. A plain white background, some sans-serif text, maybe a pastel accent color&amp;hellip; and that’s it. The result frequently feels more like an afterthought than a thoughtful simplification. It’s as if “looking clean” is being mistaken for “being considered.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Choosing a System Service Manager: A Personal Perspective</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/system-service-managers/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Jun 2025 21:25:13 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/system-service-managers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to system service managers on Linux, such as systemd, OpenRC, runit, SysVinit, and others, the conversation can quickly turn into a debate. Each has its merits, its history, and its dedicated user base. But for most people using Linux on a desktop or laptop, the differences between them often fade quietly into the background.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At their core, service managers are responsible for initializing the system, managing background services (daemons), handling dependencies, logging, and shutting down gracefully. On servers, where stability, fine-grained control, and predictability are essential, choosing the right init system can be a high-stakes decision. Administrators often require transparency, auditability, and exact behavior, especially in high-availability or containerized environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Life as a Dream: The Imagination of Ourselves</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/life-as-a-dream/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Life is only a dream, and we are the imagination of ourselves.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, this phrase sounds poetic, almost surreal. But within it lies a profound perspective on existence, one that challenges how we perceive reality, identity, and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If life is a dream, then what we call “reality” may be less solid than we think. Perception filters our experiences, memories, and beliefs, shaping them through thoughts, feelings, and stories we tell ourselves. What we think of as &amp;ldquo;me&amp;rdquo; is not fixed but fluid, a narrative continually written and rewritten in the mind&amp;rsquo;s theater.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Evolving Minimalism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional minimalism might remind us of cleaning out closets or investing in that perfect, minimalist item. But modern minimalism has evolved into a practice that touches every aspect of our lives. It encourages us to let go not only of physical items but also of the mental and emotional baggage we accumulate over time. Just as physical clutter can obscure our space, clutter in the form of old worries, negative emotions, or unhelpful habits can weigh us down and block our path to inner peace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/embracing-the-power-of-silence/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/embracing-the-power-of-silence/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a world that often feels overwhelmingly noisy, taking time to be still and speak less can have a profound impact on our wellbeing. Mindfulness isn&amp;rsquo;t just about meditation or quiet reflection—it&amp;rsquo;s about cultivating a lifestyle that values listening over constant chatter, intentionality over impulsiveness, and inner calm over external chaos. In this post, I want to try and explore the benefits of embracing silence and offer some practical tips for integrating more mindful moments into your daily.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Take on Mozilla’s New Firefox Terms of Use</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/my-take-on-mozilla-s-new-firefox-terms-of-use/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 09:40:29 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/my-take-on-mozilla-s-new-firefox-terms-of-use/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my take on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/&#34;&gt;Mozilla’s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; New Firefox &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/terms/firefox/&#34;&gt;Terms of Use&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; effective as of &lt;em&gt;February 25, 2025&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whenever Mozilla’s updated the Firefox Terms of Use, I had a read, and honestly, it left me a bit frustrated. I’m not here for any of the extra data sharing or corporate maneuvering.. I just want a straightforward, no-frills web browser.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-just-want-a-browser-not-a-data-processor&#34;&gt;I Just Want a Browser, Not a Data Processor..&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What really gets me is the part about Mozilla using my data to “help me navigate” the web. I’m all for a smooth browsing experience, but I’m not a fan of any extra sharing or selling of my data. I just want Firefox to work as a web browser without turning into a data mine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why a Derivative of a Derivative Might Not Be the Best Choice</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/derivative-of-a-derivative/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to choosing a Linux distribution, the options can feel overwhelming. From the giants like Arch, Fedora, OpenSuse and Ubuntu, to the more niche derivatives that branch off these powerhouses, there’s a flavor for just about everyone. But what happens when you venture beyond a first-layer derivative to a derivative of a derivative? While it might seem harmless, this extra step away from the “source” can sometimes create unforeseen challenges that are worth considering before you commit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it feels like we&amp;rsquo;re falling apart, like no matter what we do, we&amp;rsquo;re always falling short, making mistakes, messing things up, or that something goes wrong. But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: we&amp;rsquo;re not always any of those things. Life can simply be hard sometimes. It&amp;rsquo;s full of challenges, unexpected twists, and moments that can make us feel overwhelmed or that the weight of the world is too much to carry. There are days when it seems like giving up might be easier than pushing forward. Just sometimes, life is simply hard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reimagining Terminal Software</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the world of technology, there’s something quietly beautiful about the way people are revisiting and reimagining old terminal software. These programs, with their roots dating back to the early days of computing, have been the backbone of countless systems for decades. But as technology evolves, so do the ways we interact with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some modern developers are taking these time-tested tools and giving them a fresh coat of paint, not to erase the past but to enhance it. By rewriting and tweaking the old software, they aim to improve functionality, make interfaces more intuitive, or simply adapt the software to meet today’s needs. It’s a delicate balance—respecting the original while embracing the possibilities of the new.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the digital age, the internet has become an integral part of our daily lives. It connects us to a world of information, entertainment, and social interaction. Yet, as we immerse ourselves in this vast virtual landscape, there is a growing concern about the impact it has on our mental health and our connection to real life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-allure-of-the-digital-world&#34;&gt;The Allure of the Digital World&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The internet offers endless possibilities. From social media platforms to streaming services, online shopping to gaming, it provides an escape from the mundane and a distraction from the stresses of everyday life. However, this constant accessibility and the allure of instant gratification can also lead to a dangerous cycle of overuse and dependency.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
