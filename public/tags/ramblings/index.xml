      <description>Ideas, thoughts &amp;amp; Ramblings&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s what this blog is all about. After spending a few days playing around with Hugo offline, I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered that I actually quite like it. It&amp;rsquo;s like a refreshing change.&#xA;A Fresh Start.. Initially, my plan was to transfer all my old blog posts from Publii to this new blog. However, upon reflection, I decided against it. A few of those posts were of low quality, and frankly, I have no idea why I ever published them.</description>
