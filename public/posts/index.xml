      <description>There are lots of guides explaining Fediverse and Mastodon, but most of them go into way too much detail.

You can then gradually learn the rest from elsewhere.&#xA;The fediverse is NOT f**king twitter !! The fediverse is very different from twitter, and that&amp;rsquo;s by design.</description>

Its owner didn’t ask for much—just for it to work as expected.&#xA;Every morning, the computer was powered on with a sense of hope.</description>

She’d look in the mirror, and sometimes she’d cry, Feeling like she’d never understand why.&#xA;She set out on a journey, leaving her fears behind, With each step she took, she sought to find A purpose, a reason, a place to belong, Humming her favorite melody, a hopeful song.</description>

      <description>Ideas, thoughts &amp;amp; Ramblings&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s what this blog is all about. After spending a few days playing around with Hugo offline, I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered that I actually quite like it. It&amp;rsquo;s like a refreshing change.&#xA;A Fresh Start.. Initially, my plan was to transfer all my old blog posts from Publii to this new blog. However, upon reflection, I decided against it. A few of those posts were of low quality, and frankly, I have no idea why I ever published them.</description>

      <description>After using publii for several years, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally decided to switch to Hugo. I made the switch because I wanted a more minimalistic, less clunky, and easier-to-maintain solution.&#xA;At the moment, I&amp;rsquo;m just testing Hugo, and this post is primarily for experimental purposes. After re-uploading a few posts from my previous blog, I&amp;rsquo;ll look at my feelings towards Hugo based on my experience and the results. Depending on how I feel about it, I may or may not stick with Hugo.</description>
