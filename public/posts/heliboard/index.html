    <p>Jonny had always been curious about open-source technology, so when he heard about the open-source <a href="https://github.com/Helium314/HeliBoard">Heliboard</a> keyboard for his phone, he decided to give it a try. The idea of using an open-source keyboard for enhanced privacy intrigued him, promising a level of data security that the default keyboard just couldn&rsquo;t offer. He eagerly installed it, ready to protect his personal information.</p>
<p>However, from the moment Jonny started using Heliboard, things didn&rsquo;t go as smoothly as he had hoped. Instead of the seamless experience he anticipated, he found himself constantly mistyping words and pressing the wrong buttons. With every little thing Jonny typed, he slowly became a little frustrated. Typed text was littered with typos and autocorrect failures, and simple phrases turned into jumbled nonsense. His friends started making playful jabs at his new creative spelling.</p>
<p>Determined not to give up, Jonny delved into the settings of Heliboard. He adjusted the key sizes, tweaked various settings, and experimented with different heights. Each change brought a glimmer of hope, but the perfect combination eluded him. The frustration mounted, but so did his determination. He was not one to be defeated by a keyboard.</p>
<p>A few hours turned into a day or two, but Jonny continued on with his quest. Gradually, through using the keyboard, the mistypes became less frequent, and his typing speed improved. The keyboard, once a source of exasperation, started to feel like an extension of his thoughts.</p>
<p>One day, as Jonny swiftly typed out a message without a single error, he realised he was back to typing as he normally would. He had not only mastered the keyboard but also learned a valuable lesson in patience and perseverance.</p>
<p>In the end, Jonny&rsquo;s journey with Heliboard wasn&rsquo;t just about a keyboard. It was about the perseverance of learning to use new software and finding joy in using open source software.</p>
