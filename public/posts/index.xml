      <description>Jonny had always been curious about open-source technology, so when he heard about the open-source Heliboard keyboard for his phone, he decided to give it a try. The idea of using an open-source keyboard for enhanced privacy intrigued him, promising a level of data security that the default keyboard just couldn&amp;rsquo;t offer. He eagerly installed it, ready to protect his personal information.&#xA;However, from the moment Jonny started using Heliboard, things didn&amp;rsquo;t go as smoothly as he had hoped.</description>

      <description>There are lots of guides explaining Fediverse and Mastodon, but most of them go into way too much detail. With this post, I would like to try and cover all, or at least most, of the basics you&amp;rsquo;ll need to know to get started. You can then gradually learn the rest from elsewhere.&#xA;The fediverse is NOT f**king twitter !! The fediverse is very different from twitter, and that&amp;rsquo;s by design.</description>

      <description>In a cosy kitchen, a computer sat quietly in the corner underneath a black wooden desk. A reliable companion in a world increasingly dominated by sleek, modern devices. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t old, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t brand new either—a comfortable middle ground. Running Linux, it represented a blend of stability and versatility, though not without its quirks. Its owner didn’t ask for much—just for it to work as expected.&#xA;Every morning, the computer was powered on with a sense of hope.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, in the quiet of her room, A girl with long ginger hair, like a bloom, Felt the weight of the world, pressing down on her soul, Wondering if she’d ever find a way to be whole.&#xA;Her extensions, a cascade of fire, so bright, Reflected her spirit, her inner fight. She’d look in the mirror, and sometimes she’d cry, Feeling like she’d never understand why.&#xA;She set out on a journey, leaving her fears behind, With each step she took, she sought to find A purpose, a reason, a place to belong, Humming her favorite melody, a hopeful song.</description>

      <description>Chrome wandered through the bustling market, eyeing the vibrant display of fruit.

      <description>Ideas, thoughts &amp;amp; Ramblings&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s what this blog is all about. After spending a few days playing around with Hugo offline, I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered that I actually quite like it. It&amp;rsquo;s like a refreshing change.&#xA;A Fresh Start.. Initially, my plan was to transfer all my old blog posts from Publii to this new blog. However, upon reflection, I decided against it. A few of those posts were of low quality, and frankly, I have no idea why I ever published them.</description>

      <description>After using publii for several years, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally decided to switch to Hugo. I made the switch because I wanted a more minimalistic, less clunky, and easier-to-maintain solution.&#xA;At the moment, I&amp;rsquo;m just testing Hugo, and this post is primarily for experimental purposes. After re-uploading a few posts from my previous blog, I&amp;rsquo;ll look at my feelings towards Hugo based on my experience and the results. Depending on how I feel about it, I may or may not stick with Hugo.</description>
