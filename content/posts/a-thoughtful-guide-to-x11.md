In the ever-evolving world of Linux desktop environments, there's been a clear trend: **Wayland*+ is growing. It's sleek, modern, and promises a more secure and efficient future. But for many of us, **Xorg (X11)*+ still represents stability, flexibility, and control.

Whether you're on older hardware, running highly configurable window managers, or just appreciate the tried-and-true reliability of X11, this post is for you.

Let’s explore the wide variety of **Xorg-based desktop environments** that continue to thrive, not as resistance to change, but as a celebration of *freedom of choice*.

## Why Choose Xorg Today?

Before diving into the desktop environments, let’s consider why you may still stick with Xorg:

+ **Mature software support**
  Xorg has been around for decades and remains well-supported by a majority of desktop applications and toolkits.

+ **Better compatibility**
  Certain graphics drivers, legacy applications, and niche tools still work best, *or only* on Xorg.

+ **Freedom of choice**
  In the Linux world, choosing your tools is a feature, not a flaw. Xorg offers one of many valid paths.

## Desktop Environments That Use Xorg (Alphabetical List)

These environments either run exclusively on Xorg or offer robust support for it, even if they’re exploring Wayland compatibility. Some are minimal, others full-featured, but all respect the X11 legacy.

---

### **[AfterStep](http://www.afterstep.org/)**

+ Inspired by NeXTSTEP, AfterStep offers a unique aesthetic with docks and wharfs. Lightweight and resource-efficient, it remains a visual throwback with modern functionality.

---

### **[Blackbox](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Blackbox)**

+ A minimalist window manager with desktop environment traits. Known for speed and simplicity, Blackbox laid the groundwork for several derivatives like Fluxbox.

---

### **[DDE (Deepin Desktop Environment)](https://www.deepin.org/en/dde/)**

---

### **[EDE (Equinox Desktop Environment)](https://edeproject.org/)**

+ A super lightweight desktop built with FLTK. EDE boots fast, runs on old hardware, and uses very few resources. Xorg is a perfect match for its minimalist intentions.

---

### **[Enlightenment](https://www.enlightenment.org/)**

+ Known for its eye candy and effects, Enlightenment combines compositing with performance. Though Wayland support is coming, X11 remains its primary home for now.

---

### **[IceWM](https://ice-wm.org/)**

+ Extremely fast and Windows-like, IceWM is ideal for low-resource machines. Though often just a window manager, it can be extended into a full DE with panels and tray tools.

---

### **[LXDE (Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment)](http://www.lxde.org/)**

+ LXDE was purpose-built for Xorg. It's incredibly fast, GTK2-based, and still widely used on older systems and distros like Debian.

---

### **[LXQt](https://lxqt-project.org/)**

+ The Qt-based successor to LXDE. Although it's forward-looking, LXQt maintains strong X11 support and performs great on everything from Raspberry Pis to low-spec laptops.

---

### **[MATE](https://mate-desktop.org/)**

+ A continuation of GNOME 2, MATE combines familiarity with modern enhancements. Its Xorg support is solid and well-documented, making it a favorite for those who like traditional desktops.

---

### **[NsCDE (Not so Common Desktop Environment)](https://github.com/NsCDE/NsCDE)**

+ Once the face of commercial UNIX systems, CDE is now open-source. It uses Motif widgets and sticks closely to the classic UNIX desktop metaphor. X11 is core to its architecture.

----

### **[Notion](https://notionwm.net/)**

+ A tiling window manager with scripting support and a modular layout. Notion is built for X11, offering a fast and productive desktop experience for keyboard-focused users.

---

### **[Openbox](https://openbox.org/)**

+ A highly customizable window manager often used as a base for lightweight desktops. It doesn’t include a panel or menu out of the box, but it pairs well with tools like `tint2` or `xfce4-panel`.

---

### **[Pantheon](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pantheon)**

+ Designed by the Elementary OS team, Pantheon offers a clean, intuitive interface. Though there's talk of a Wayland move, the current stable builds run well on Xorg.

---

### **[ROX Desktop](https://rox.sourceforge.net/desktop/)**

+ A lesser-known but fast and responsive environment, centered around the ROX-Filer. ROX Desktop is minimal, modular, and perfectly suited to Xorg.

---

### **[Sugar](https://www.sugarlabs.org/)**

+ Originally created for OLPC (One Laptop per Child), Sugar is a learning platform for children. It remains active and runs well on Xorg, especially in educational environments.

---

### **[TDE (Trinity Desktop Environment)](https://www.trinitydesktop.org/)**

+ A fork of KDE 3.5, Trinity keeps the classic KDE look and feel alive. It’s fully X11-based, deeply configurable, and beloved by users who prefer “the way things used to be.”

---

### **[VTWM (Virtual Tabbed Window Manager)](http://www.vtwm.org/)**

+ A very old-school window manager that introduces tabbed windows in a classic X11 environment. Lightweight and highly usable for advanced users.

---

### **[Window Maker](https://www.windowmaker.org/)**

+ Inspired by NeXTSTEP, Window Maker offers a dock-based layout with minimal overhead. Still actively maintained, it’s X11-only and great for retro computing enthusiasts.

---

### **[XFCE](https://www.xfce.org/)**

+ One of the most popular Xorg-first environments. Xfce balances performance and features, and while Wayland support is planned for future versions, X11 remains its stable ground.

## Final Thoughts: It’s Not About “Old vs New”

Wayland brings promise, and for many, it’s the right choice. But choice is the keyword here. Xorg still serves an essential role in modern Linux computing, especially where flexibility, performance, or legacy hardware is concerned.

This isn’t about holding back progress. It’s about respecting diverse workflows and making sure users can run what they want, how they want.

So whether you’re a minimalist, a power user, or just someone who prefers what works Xorg still has a place at the table.
