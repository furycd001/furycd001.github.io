      <description>&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s digital age, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to accumulate a cluttered and overwhelming collection of bookmarks in your web browser. A disorganized bookmark list can make it difficult to find what you need and can contribute to digital overwhelm.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are lots of guides explaining Fediverse and Mastodon, but most of them go into way too much detail. With this post, I would like to try and cover all, or at least most, of the basics you&amp;rsquo;ll need to know to get started. You can then gradually learn the rest from elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-fediverse-is-not-fking-twitter-&#34;&gt;The fediverse is NOT f**king twitter !!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fediverse is very different from twitter, and that&amp;rsquo;s by design. It&amp;rsquo;s made for building communities and bringing people together, not dividing people or for boosting celebrities. Things will certainly work differently from what you&amp;rsquo;re probably used to. Just give it some time, and ask for help if you&amp;rsquo;re not sure why something works how it does! People on the fediverse are usually happy to explain, as long as it&amp;rsquo;s a genuine question. People on the fediverse expect you to talk to them like they&amp;rsquo;re real human beings, and in return they will do the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
