This is my take on **[Mozilla’s](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/)** New Firefox **[Terms of Use](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/terms/firefox/)** effective as of *February 25, 2025*.

Whenever Mozilla’s updated the Firefox Terms of Use, I had a read, and honestly, it left me a bit frustrated. I’m not here for any of the extra data sharing or corporate maneuvering.. I just want a straightforward, no-frills web browser.


## I Just Want a Browser, Not a Data Processor..

What really gets me is the part about Mozilla using my data to “help me navigate” the web. I’m all for a smooth browsing experience, but I’m not a fan of any extra sharing or selling of my data. I just want Firefox to work as a web browser without turning into a data mine.


## Open Source or Open Data Mine?

Yes, Firefox is open source, which sounds great at first. The idea that I can see and even modify the source code is appealing. But that openness doesn’t mean I’m okay with my information being processed and possibly shared. I’m not interested in any “political stuff” or “funky business”—just a clean browser that does its job without any extra baggage.


## Optional Features Mean Optional Exposure..

I get that some features like syncing requires creating a Mozilla account—and I'm okay with that if I need that functionality. However, it's not the convenience that concerns me; it's the planned handling and processing of my data that I’m not comfortable with. I’d rather keep my browsing simple and private without opening the door to additional data tracking.


## Updates, Changes, and the Fine Print..

Mozilla’s terms also say they can update or even terminate the service whenever they want. While I understand this is standard legal talk, it just adds to the sense that I’m giving up more control than I’m comfortable with. If things change in ways I don’t agree with, I’d rather just switch to another browser than deal with unexpected new terms.


## The Bottom Line..

At the end of the day, Mozilla’s updated Terms of Use seem more about protecting the company and facilitating extra data collection than about giving me a straightforward tool for browsing. I want a browser that is just that—a browser. No extra data processing, no political angles, no “extras” that aren’t necessary for simply surfing the web.
