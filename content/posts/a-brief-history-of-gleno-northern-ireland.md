Nestled in the picturesque landscapes of County Antrim, Northern Ireland, the small village of Gleno is often overlooked by visitors, yet its charm and history make it a fascinating stop for those seeking to explore Northern Ireland's rich heritage. Though small in size, Gleno is a village steeped in local lore, natural beauty, and historical significance.


### Origins and Name
The name *Gleno*, or *Glenoe*, is derived from the Irish *Gleann Ó*, meaning "Glen of the mass or lump." This name reflects the unique geological features of the area, including the prominent hills and rock formations that frame the village. Located in County Antrim, Gleno is located near a scenic waterfall that feeds into a meandering stream, a feature that has shaped much of its early history, and has attracted settlement for centuries due to its scenic beauty and the life-giving stream that flows through the valley. Gleno's tranquil surroundings, characterized by rolling hills and lush greenery, have made it an attractive spot for human settlement for centuries, with roots stretching back to early farming communities.


## The Waterfall: A Local Gem
One of the most iconic landmarks in Gleno is its stunning waterfall. Located just outside the village, Gleno Waterfall is part of a nature reserve managed by the National Trust. The waterfall has long been a centerpiece of local pride and natural beauty. Historically, it provided both a source of water and power for the early industries in the region. Today, it is a popular attraction for visitors seeking a peaceful retreat into nature or a scenic walk through the surrounding woodlands.


## Historical Significance
Gleno’s historical significance is shaped by both its economic ties to nearby Larne and Carrickfergus and its enduring charm as a picturesque village. During the 18th and 19th centuries, County Antrim was a vital region for agriculture and the linen industry, and Gleno benefited from its proximity to these larger trade hubs. While the village itself remained small, its location allowed goods and people to pass through, connecting it to broader economic activity across Northern Ireland. In addition to its agricultural roots, Gleno became a popular destination in the 19th and early 20th centuries for travelers seeking the natural beauty of Northern Ireland’s landscapes. Perched on a plateau, the village offered idyllic views and the famous Gleno Waterfall, which drew countless visitors. In 1845, one traveler described scrambling down a steep, forested slope to the waterfall’s base, surrounded by mountain ash trees so thick that sunlight could scarcely filter through. The waterfall, now under the care of the National Trust, was already a beloved attraction, inviting those in search of quaint, peaceful scenery—a timeless appeal that endures to this day.


## Architectural Heritage and Restoration
Gleno’s historical architecture is a testament to its past, with quaint whitewashed, thatched cottages. While many of these charming buildings have been modernized over time, some historic terraces remain, such as the row of cottages numbered 7-10. Perched on a steep hillside that once led up to a stone corn mill, these cottages offer a glimpse into the village’s bygone era. Number 10, for instance, served as a pub in earlier days and still retains its original, narrow room layout and storeroom alley. By the 1980s, however, these cottages had fallen into disrepair, with many left vacant and vandalized. Fortunately, the restoration efforts by the organization Hearth helped preserve this architectural legacy. Hearth carefully converted the cottages into interconnected homes while maintaining their historic front elevations and original green and white color scheme. This blend of preservation and modernization reflects Gleno’s commitment to honoring its past while ensuring that its architectural heritage continues to serve the community today.
