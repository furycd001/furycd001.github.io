      <description>&lt;p&gt;For as long as I’ve used Linux, Ubuntu has been a name I associated with approachability &amp;amp; stability. It was often the distribution I recommended to new users, an accessible introduction to the wider Linux world that made things feel less intimidating. But lately, I’ve found myself pausing, and not just pausing, but reconsidering whether Ubuntu is still aligned with what I value in a Linux distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-new-direction&#34;&gt;A New Direction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few cycles, Ubuntu has started replacing long-standing GNU tools like coreutils, curl, diff, findutils, HTTPie, sudo, and even wget with modern rewrites. Tools like uutils, sudo-rs and xh are being introduced as defaults in some images, replacing their tried-and-tested counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
