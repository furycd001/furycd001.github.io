But here&amp;rsquo;s the truth: there’s no shame in asking questions—only in missing out on the opportunity to learn. Asking questions is one of the most powerful tools we have for learning and growth. It’s not a sign of weakness; it’s a sign of curiosity, courage, and a genuine desire to understand the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
