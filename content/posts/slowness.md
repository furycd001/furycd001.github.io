Slowness. It’s almost a lost art these days.

We live in a world that’s obsessed with fast. The fastest boot-up time. The fastest internet. The fastest file transfers. Even in the world of websites, where once people took joy in hand-crafting code and experimenting with every detail, the trend now is drag-and-drop builders like Squarespace or Wix, instant websites, instant gratification.

And yet, somewhere in all that speed, something gets lost.

It’s not that there’s anything wrong with efficiency. Fast can be wonderful when it frees us up to do more of the things that matter. But when everything becomes about shaving seconds off a process or rushing to the finish line, we miss out on the richness of actually being present with what we’re doing.

Slowness is not laziness. It’s not inefficiency. It’s an intentional act. It’s choosing to breathe between steps instead of sprinting blindly to the next one.

Think of learning to code line by line, debugging along the way, instead of simply relying on a template someone else made. These things take longer, yes, but they bring with them a sense of grounding, a connection to process, and a deep, quiet joy that speed often robs us of.

We’re told, “You only live once, so live fast.” But what if it’s the opposite? What if living fully requires us to slow down, to taste, to notice, to linger?

Because at the end of the day, the ride isn’t about how quickly we can reach the end. It’s about the journey itself, the details, the pauses, the stillness in between.

So maybe the next time you feel the urge to rush, try leaning into slowness instead. You may just find it’s not a waste of time, but a way of giving more meaning to the time you already have.
